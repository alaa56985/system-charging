					<h2>Progect Description:</h2>
					<p>Applicants shall provide a brief description of their project. This description should include the following according to the distribution of scores
						<br>
						Energy is at the heart of the climate challenge – and key to the solution.
						A large chunk of the greenhouse gases that blanket the Earth and trap the sun’s heat are generated through energy production, by burning fossil fuels to generate electricity and heat.
						Fossil fuels, such as coal, oil and gas, are by far  accounting for over 75 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions and nearly 90 percent of all carbon dioxide emissions.
						The science is clear: to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, emissions need to be reduced by almost half by 2030 and reach net-zero by 2050.
						To achieve this, we need to end our reliance on fossil fuels and invest in alternative sources of energy that are clean, accessible, affordable, sustainable, and reliable.
						Renewable energy sources – which are available in abundance all around us, provided by the sun, wind, water, waste, and heat from the Earth – are replenished by nature and emit little to no greenhouse gases or pollutants into the air.
						Fossil fuels still account for more than 80 percent of global energy production, but cleaner sources of energy are gaining ground. About 29 percent of electricity currently comes from renewable sources.
						Here are five reasons why accelerating the transition to clean energy is the pathway to a healthy, livable planet today and for generations to come.
						Social Impacts of Solar Energy
						The technological innovation of solar energy enables solar panels to capture the heat of the sun and utilize the energy to generate power and electricity for homes, buildings and cities. Solar panels help maximize the earth's resources and conserve energy. However, many social benefits can result from the use of solar energy in the United States.
						It helps the market to maneuver towards the utilization of renewable energy and scale back the use of fossil fuels that cause warming end user.
						Helps lessen international warming, offer renewable electricity for some of people, a few can also additionally want to rate telephones or rate the auto battery, so it is a superb opportunit
						By the year 2030, this field are key to getting total energy, achieving equal access to energy, achieving equality in obtaining help in advancing the economy and national competitiveness, and to achieving leadership within the fields of renewable energy in numerous fields
